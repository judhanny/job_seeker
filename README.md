# job_seeker
## Background
A proof of concept (POC) application to help you track and organise your job applications. 

The technical aim of this POC was to show how an end user would be able to add job applications, view application statistics and navigate to more granular detail with ease.  

### Functionality
The POC provides the following functionality.

- Loads sample job applications "from the internet" on start up.
- Provides a dashboard as home page with some simple charting displaying statistics on applications. 
- Enables users to navigate from the dashboard to job applications in a simple, intuitive way.  
- Uses validated forms to support the input of new job applications.
- Reuses the forms to support a read only view of existing applications.

### Future Work
Plenty of future work is on the cards for this application. This repo will remain static however, to provide a faithful representation of the POC for interested parties.
